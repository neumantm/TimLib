# TimLib
This is collection of useful methods and classes made by me.

It is licensed under Mozilla Public License Version 2.0. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more information.

I know that, there some are popular (and probably better) alternatives for at least some of them.
But I just wanted to do it my self. And most of them are extractions from other projects, 
so they exist anyway and i just collect them here.

## Overview
### Misc

 - case(in)sensitive searching of Strings in a String Array
### Log
